## Core Features:

- Medicine Identification: Identify medical products (tablet strip, syrup, etc.) from a short video or image using AI. Extracts key details like name and usage.
- Personalized Guidance: Provide health guidance based on user details (age, gender, symptoms). The system checks if the scanned medicine is suitable, and warns of side effects.
- Fake & Expiry Detection: Flag expired, counterfeit, or unverified products using AI and public health data.
- Language Translation: Translate medical jargon into simple explanations in local languages (Urdu, Punjabi, Sindhi, Pashto, Balochi) in both speech and text.
- Medicine Details Display: Clearly display the extracted medicine details (name, purpose, usage, expiry, authenticity check).
- Guidance Display: Clearly show personalized health guidance and warnings in an accessible format.
- Pharmacy Recommendations: Connect users with local verified pharmacies.
- Voice Based AI Assistant: The user can speak in local languages (Urdu, Balochi, Pashto, Sindhi, Siraiki). The assistant converts speech to text and finds the mentioned symptoms or conditions. Based on that, the AI will suggest solutions, assistance, and guidance and answer questions about the uploaded medicine, checking its suitability for the patient's current situation, age, etc. The LLM will use reasoning to decide when or if to incorporate some piece of information in its output. This is a tool.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#94C6E6) evoking trust and health, inspired by clear skies. In HSL, the hue is close to cyan, saturation is low, and brightness is moderate.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F8FF), almost white. Its HSL value matches the primary color, except the saturation is very low and brightness is very high to ensure it stands clearly apart from the UI.
- Accent color: Light green (#A0D6B4), a refreshing and healing color to draw attention to key elements and CTAs; in HSL this hue sits close to the primary color, but is clearly distinguished by a jump in both saturation and brightness.
- Font pairing: 'Belleza' (sans-serif) for headlines, and 'Alegreya' (serif) for body text.
- Use clean, modern icons with rounded corners for a friendly feel.
- Prioritize clear, uncluttered layouts with ample whitespace for easy readability.
- Use subtle animations to provide feedback and guide the user through the app (e.g., a loading animation while processing video, a slide-in animation for displaying medicine details).
